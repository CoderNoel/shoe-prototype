# Smart Shoe ‚Äì Health & Fitness Interface Simulation

## üëü Project Overview

This project is a **web-based simulation prototype** of a Smart Shoe with health and fitness tracking capabilities. The concept represents a wearable shoe that **projects a UI onto the floor** and allows **hands-free interaction using foot tilts** (left/right/forward). The simulation demonstrates the user experience in a desktop browser using **cursor tracking and mouse clicks** as the primary interaction method, with keyboard controls as a backup option.

## üåü Key Features

- **Hands-free Workout Experience**: Track workouts and health metrics without touching a screen
- **Natural Interaction**: Use cursor movements to simulate foot tilt gestures
- **Projected Interface**: UI appears as if projected onto the floor from the shoe
- **Real-time Metrics**: Monitor steps, heart rate, calories, and more during workouts
- **Workout Completion**: View achievements and sync with Apple Health
- **Voice Feedback**: Simulated voice assistive technology with on-screen text
- **Multiple Control Options**: Mouse, keyboard shortcuts, or on-screen buttons

## üíª Primary Interaction Method

This simulation uses **cursor position tracking** as the primary interaction method:

- **Cursor at top of screen**: Activates tilt controls (moves shoe left/right)
- **Hovering over UI elements**: Automatically tilts the shoe in that direction
- **Clicking**: Represents a forward tilt to select/confirm

This approach creates an intuitive way to simulate how users would interact with the projected interface using natural foot movements.

## üé® Design Elements

- **Projected Interface**: UI elements appear with perspective, shadows, and glow effects
- **Shoe Visualization**: Virtual shoe shows tilt animations to represent foot movements
- **Projection Light**: Green light at shoe tip shows where the interface projects from
- **Circular Menus**: Intuitive circular interface for easy navigation with foot tilts
- **Progress Visualization**: 3D path representation of workout progress
- **Adaptive Feedback**: Visual cues for interactions and achievements

## üì± Device Compatibility

- **Desktop**: Full experience with all features (recommended)
- **Tablet**: Compatible with touch-based controls
- **Mobile**: Not supported - displays compatibility message explaining desktop requirement

## üß† Design Principles

- **Natural Mapping**: Interface movement matches physical foot movements
- **Glanceable Information**: Important metrics visible at a glance for safety during workouts
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed as needed to prevent overwhelm
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual responses to all user actions
- **Motivational Design**: Encouraging feedback and achievement celebration

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

For the optimal experience when testing this prototype:

1. Use a **desktop browser** (Chrome or Firefox recommended)
2. Position screen at a **comfortable viewing angle**
3. Try all interaction methods (mouse tracking, keyboard, buttons)
4. Complete the full workout simulation flow
5. Test various workout types and goals
6. Observe the end-to-end experience from start to finish

## üîß Technical Implementation

This prototype is built with:
- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling, animations, and visual effects
- **JavaScript** for interactions and simulation logic
- **No external JS libraries** for maximum compatibility

All interactions are handled through event listeners that translate mouse/keyboard input into simulated foot movement represented visually in the interface.

## üìù Final Notes

This simulation represents a **proof-of-concept for usability testing** rather than a production application. It demonstrates the interaction model and UI approach for projected interfaces controlled by foot gestures, enabling evaluation of this novel interaction paradigm without requiring specialized hardware.
